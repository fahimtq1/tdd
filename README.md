# Test Driven Development Basics

## What is Test Driven Development (TDD)?

TDD is the software development practice of creating unit tests before producing the actual code of a program. In this way, the tests are given priority, thus the tests themselves drive development. It's roots are derived from the Agile Manifesto, as can be seen in its iterative nature and other principles that will be covered below.

## TDD lifecycle

There are five parts to TDD lifecycle:

1. Write the test case
3. Run the test
4. Write the minimum amount of code required for the test to pass
5. Refactor the code
6. Repeat the cycle
